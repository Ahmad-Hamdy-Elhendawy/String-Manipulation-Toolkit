# String Analyzer - Beginner C++ Project

This is a simple C++ console program that allows users to perform various string-related operations, such as:

- Counting how many times a specific letter appears in a string.
- Printing the first letter of each word.
- Capitalizing or lowercasing the first letter of every word.
- Converting the entire string to uppercase or lowercase.
- Inverting the case of each letter.
- Counting how many capital and small letters are in the string.

## üîß Features

- Input full sentences (including spaces).
- Input a specific character to search for.
- Clean and modular code split into reusable functions.
- Great for beginners learning string manipulation in C++.

## üí° How to Run

1. Copy the code into your C++ IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, etc.).
2. Compile and run the program.
3. Follow the console prompts to test string operations.
